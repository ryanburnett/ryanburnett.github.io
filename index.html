# Additional Configuration

- Create a Static IP and Attach It To An Instance In Amazon Lightsail
- Creating a DNS Zone to Manage Your Domain’s DNS Records
- Connecting to Your Instance in Amazon Lightsail Using SFTP

---

# Create a Static IP and Attach It To An Instance In Amazon Lightsail

The default dynamic public IP address attached to your Amazon Lightsail instance changes every time you stop and restart the instance. Create a static IP address and attach it to your instance to keep the public IP address from changing. Later, when you point a registered domain name to your instance, you don’t have to update your domain’s DNS records every time you stop and restart your instance.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-create-static-ip

---

# Creating a DNS Zone to Manage Your Domain’s DNS Records

We recommend that you transfer management of your domain's DNS records to Lightsail. This allows you to efficiently administer all of your instance resources in one place—the Lightsail console.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry

---

# Connecting to Your Instance in Amazon Lightsail Using SFTP

You can transfer files between your local computer and your Linux or Unix instance in Amazon Lightsail by connecting to your instance using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol). To do this, you must get the private key for your instance, and then use it to configure the FTP client.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-connecting-to-linux-unix-instance-using-sftp

---

# Decouple the Database From the Instance

Crucial WordPress website data for posts, pages, and users, is stored on the MySQL database that is running on the instance in Amazon Lightsail. If the WordPress instance fails, your data may become unrecoverable. To avoid this scenario, you should transfer your website data to a MySQL managed database in Amazon Lightsail.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-connect-wordpress-to-mysql-managed-database

---

# Create a MySQL DB

Create a MySQL managed database in Lightsail in the same AWS Region as your WordPress instance, and make sure it's in a running state. WordPress works with all of the MySQL database options available in Lightsail.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-a-database

---

# Transfer the WordPress DB to a MySQL DB

Transfer your WordPress website data for posts, pages, and users, to your MySQL managed database in Lightsail.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-connect-wordpress-to-mysql-managed-database#transfer-wordpress-database-to-mysql-managed-database

---

# Configure WordPress to Connect to Your MySQL DB

Edit the WordPress configuration file so that your website connects to your MySQL managed database

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-connect-wordpress-to-mysql-managed-database#configure-wordpress-to-connect-to-mysql-managed-database

---

# Creating a Snapshot of Your Linux or Unix Instance in Amazon Lightsail

An instance snapshot is a copy of the system disk and matches the original machine configuration (memory, CPU, disk size, and data transfer rate).

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-create-a-snapshot-of-your-instance

---

# Creating a Snapshot of Your Database in Amazon Lightsail

A snapshot is a copy of your database that you can use to restore it if something goes wrong. You can also use a snapshot to create a new database using a different plan, such as a high availability or standard plan.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-a-database-snapshot

---

# Configuring the Public Mode for Your Database in Amazon Lightsail

Your managed database in Amazon Lightsail is accessible only by your Lightsail resources (instances, load balancers, etc.) that are in the same Lightsail account. One common scenario is to create both a Lightsail instance with a public-facing web application and a Lightsail database that is not publicly accessible, and then connect the two.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-configuring-database-public-mode

---

# Create a Lightsail Load Balancer and Attach Instances to It

Create a Lightsail load balancer to add redundancy to your application or to handle more web traffic. After the load balancer is created, you can attach the Lightsail instances that you want to balance.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/create-lightsail-load-balancer-and-attach-lightsail-instances

---

# Create an SSL/TLS Certificate for Your Lightsail Load Balancer

After you create a Lightsail load balancer, you can attach a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to enable HTTPS. The SSL/TLS certificate lets your load balancer handle encrypted web traffic so that you can provide a more secure experience for your users.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/create-tls-ssl-certificate-and-attach-to-lightsail-load-balancer-https

---

# Verify an SSL/TLS Certificate in Amazon Lightsail

After you create your Lightsail load balancer and create a certificate, you need to verify that you control all the domains and subdomains where you want to have encrypted (HTTPS) traffic.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/verify-tls-ssl-certificate-using-dns-cname-https

---

# Attach a Validated SSL/TLS Certificate to Your Lightsail Load Balancer

After you verify that you control your domain, you'll receive a notification on the Lightsail load balancer management page. Your next step is to attach the certificate to your Lightsail load balancer.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/attach-validated-certificate-to-load-balancer

---

# Create an Access Key to Use the Amazon Lightsail API or the AWS CLI

To use the Lightsail API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you need to create a new access key. The access key consists of an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. Use the following procedures to create the key and configure the AWS CLI to make calls to the Lightsail API.

https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli
